/*
 * Constructors are Specialzed type of method whose name is  same as a class name
 * It doesnt have return type
 * Constructor are divided into 3 types 
 * 1) Parameterized 
 * 2)Zero Parameterized
   3) Default Constructor
 * If user doesnt provide any constructor The Java Compiler provide Default constructor(zero para)
  Constructor overloading : Creating multiple constructors within in same class is know as constructor overloding. But constructors have different parameters like method overloading
  constructor chaining : is a process where one constructor calls another constructor is known as CC with in same Class is called Constructor Chanining.
  There are Two Ways to Acheive Constructor Chanining
   1) Within Same Class
   2) child class to parent class
   Local Chaining : if constrctor calls another constructor within same class we can use this()
   Super() : if constrctor calls another constructor which is present in different class then we use super()       
   Can we make Constructors as Private ? Yes we can
